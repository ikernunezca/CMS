##### INPUT FILES FOR FIGURE REPRODUCIBILITY

All Source Data files for plotting are provided within the github repository of the project: https://github.com/ikernunezca/CMS
We specifically provide the Cytoscape Session file (‘.cys’) containing all the plots used to produce Figures 3 and 4, as well as Supplementary Figures 3, 6, and 8 in this link: https://github.com/ikernunezca/CMS/blob/master/Cytoscape_Session/CMS_Session.cys

Specific input Source Data Files for creating the Cytoscape Session used to build Figure 3, 4A, 4B, 6 and 8 can be accessed from the following link as csv files: 
https://github.com/ikernunezca/CMS/tree/master/Cytoscape_Session

Additionally, the Cytoscape Session provides an extra plot with the incident interactions considered to build Figure 5, which was manually rendered.

Supplementary Figure 1 source data is provided as Supplementary Table 1. 

Input Data for reproducing Supplementary Figure 2 can be accessed from:
https://github.com/ikernunezca/CMS/tree/master/data/InputGenes

Cytoscape Session with the graphics used to build Figures 3 and 4, as well as Supplementary Figures 3, 6, and 8 is provided as a .cys file ('CMS_Session.cys').

1. Source input for Figures 3 and 4 -> 'Figure3_input.csv': A csv file providing an edgelist where nodes are connected if they are together at least at 1 value of resolution. Columns Var1 and Var2 provide the node names and
value indicates the number of resolution values at which the 2 nodes where NOT toghether across the range. Nodes that are always together have a value of 0. 

2. Input for Supplementary Figure 3 -> Available in ~/CMS/Plots/. Edgelists, in csv format, providing the communities obtained in the script 'LouvainClustering_Supplementary_Figure_3_&_4.ipynb'. File naming: 'SupplementaryFigure_3interactomenotsevere.csv'

3. Node metadata -> Files 'NOTSevereMetadata_Figure4_Supp_Fig_6.csv' and 'SevereMetadata_Figure4_Supp_Fig_6.csv': 2 column files, providing, for each node (1st column), the mutation type detected, and / or if it is also known to be a causal gene of the disease.
This metadata is used to color the nodes of the Figures. 

4. Source layer interactions used for building Figure 5 (natively rendered with Google Slides) are provided as an extra figure within the Cytoscape Session.
